# HOCEP-Resource-Directory-Project
Resource Directory Website for the Oppurtunity Center of El Paso.

Easiest way to run demo is to use PHP Storm's Built In Web Server.
The site is structured using webpack for some files. The project will be structured and minified once it is completed.

## Steps to running demo
1. [Install PHP Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
2. Configure PHP Storm's Built-In Web Server
3. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. Open the command line to the project directory and run '''npm install'''. This should access the 'package.json' file to insall the node dependencies on your computer.

## Guidelines to commiting to branches
* Use the '.gitignore' file to ingore files that should not be committed. (i.e. .idea files provided by PHP Storm, 'node_modules' files)
* Only source files and runtime dependencies (i.e. 'package.json', 'package-lock.json') should be included.

## Merging to the 'master' branch
1. All branches must be pull requested before attempting to merge.
2. Code must be reviewed by at least one of the contributors including the repository owner before accepting the request.
